        "\n",
        "### SVM Model Performance:\n",
        "- **Accuracy:** The SVM model has a very high accuracy of approximately 99.85%. However, accuracy is not always the best measure, especially if the classes are imbalanced.\n",
        "- **Precision:** Precision for the majority class (class 0) is perfect (1.00), and very high for the minority class (class 1) at 0.98.\n",
        "- **Recall:** Recall is also perfect for the majority class and very high for the minority class (1.00), indicating the model is correctly identifying all positive cases.\n",
        "- **F1-Score:** The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, is perfect for the majority class and very high for the minority class (0.99).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the SVM model is performing exceptionally well across all metrics. The high F1-score for the minority class is particularly impressive, suggesting the model is performing well in identifying the minority class despite potential class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### KNN Model Performance:\n",
        "- **Accuracy:** The KNN model has a lower accuracy of approximately 87.75%.\n",
        "- **Precision:** There is a large discrepancy in precision between the majority class (0.96) and the minority class (0.26). This suggests that when the model predicts an instance as class 1, it is correct only 26% of the time.\n",
        "- **Recall:** Recall for the majority class is lower than perfect at 0.91, indicating some instances of class 0 are being missed. The recall for the minority class is higher (0.46), indicating it's better at catching true positives of class 1 than the precision suggests.\n",
        "- **F1-Score:** The F1-score for the majority class is high (0.93), but much lower for the minority class (0.33), showing a moderate performance for the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The KNN model is not performing as well as the SVM, particularly in terms of precision and F1-score for the minority class. The higher recall for the minority class at the expense of precision suggests the model may be over-predicting the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "The SVM model is performing excellently and is well-suited to this dataset, managing to identify the minority class without sacrificing precision or recall. On the other hand, the KNN model is struggling, particularly with precision for the minority class, which leads to a lower F1-score.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that these results are based on the test set. It's important to ensure that these metrics are not the result of overfitting and that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Cross-validation could be used to help validate these results. If the dataset is highly imbalanced, it would also be worthwhile to look at the confusion matrix or other metrics such as the ROC-AUC score."
